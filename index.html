<img id="school"src="founder.jpg">
<h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>bishop foss westcott</kbd></h4>
    <p class="text-muted">Bishop Westcott Girls’ School was founded by Rt. Revd.(Dr.) Foss Westcott in 1921. Formerly an Anglican
         School, it now belongs to Chotanagpur Diocese (Church of North India). It provides education through
          the medium of English for over 2000 children, of all communities as boarders and day scholars. 
          The Chairman of the Governing Body is the Bishop of Chotanagpur Diocese, Church of North India.
           The school belongs to the conference of Anglo-Indian Schools and was recognized by the then Govt.
            of Bihar. It is subject to inspection by the inspector of Anglo-Indian Schools in Jharkhand.</p>
<p class="text-muted">
        The School is situated seven kilometres from Ranchi on the healthy Chotanagpur Plateau at an altit
        ude of 2,000 ft. The school buildings and the playground are spacious. The aim of the school is to
         give sound education in order to develop the whole personality providing best opportunity for mental,
          physical, overall growth and moral development in each child. Children are encouraged to become 
          responsible and self reliant and are taught to consider the needs of one another both in school
           and in the larger communities to which they belong. The main goal of our institution is to 
           inculcate in a child, the respect for all in society, towards religion and other communities,
            this, thus develops in a child the basis of life, trust in God, and a sense of responsibility
             to all mankind. A high standard of behavior is maintained and children are taught to give due 
             respect to their elders and to appreciate and regard the opinion of others. Thus discipline plays
a vital role in our institution.<br></p>

   </p><p class="text-muted">Being the head of the institution, I always look forward, to our motto “Onward and Upward” and march ahead and add numerous illustrious feathers, to the cap of Bishop Westcott Girls’ School, Namkom. In the end, I would like to extend my gratitude towards the Standing Council and Management, for their steadfast approach, vision and constant support in helping and believing in me, in every way, to take this school to great heights.
